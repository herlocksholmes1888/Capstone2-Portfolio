# Hello, {YOU}! Welcome to my portfolio!
My name is Luisa Lopes (she/her). I'm a developer in training from Brazil.  
This website aims to showcase my abilities, be it my hard skills, my education or my community work. It was initially created as a challenge from [The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/), by Angela Yu, but it evolved to mean much more than a challenge from a Bootcamp to me. As it is one of my first full-length projects, expect it to be updated the more I get my hands dirty on programming concepts, aswell as the more I better my understanding of Web Design.

Click [here](https://herlocksholmes1888.github.io/Capstone2-Portfolio/) for a shortcut to take a look at it. As of now, the website is not finished. I still need to add responsiveness to the Languages section, aswell as adding my language proficiency level above or below each flag. There is also the issue that the images on the Community section lack Alt Text, and it will be patched soon.
